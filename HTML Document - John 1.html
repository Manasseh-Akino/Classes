        <p> The Chronicles of Narnia is a very cool movie to watch. You should check it out. It's best if you see it in the cinema.<br>
        One of my favorite movies in the world is Flushed Away. It's an animation that talks about the problem with materialism,<br>
    and the importance of family. It's not about how much you have but who can share it with.</p>

    <p>Another wonderful movie you can watch is <strong>Over the Hedge</strong>. It's a very funny animation that delves into the subject<br>
    of treating people well. It's a great family movie to watch and enjoy together. Be ready to have lots of laughs!</p>
